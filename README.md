My simple ass pong game in SFML
This was built in c++ with sfml framework, i advice to not compile this shit but rather just look at the source to discover how it's made etc..

If you want to try it download the compiled game: https://github.com/spidernukleo/simple-pong/releases/

You can move left player with W and S keys and right player with UP and DOWN keys

Press space to start new match everytime
